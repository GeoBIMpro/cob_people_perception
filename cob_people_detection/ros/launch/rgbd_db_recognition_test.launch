	<!-- RGBD_DB_Recognition_Test - works on Head-Detections from database found at www.vap.aau.dk/rgb-d-face-database/.imports face detector and face recognizer. Point rgbd_db_directory parameter to location of head-database. Set parameters in rgbd_db_recognition_test.yaml to test recognition across sets.
	Convert database from integer to float values using the python converter. Isolate head detections by running cob_people_detection, the scene_publisher and head_isolator. The scene_publisher creates and publishes pointclouds from the databases depth values.
	cob_people_detections receives the pointclouds like normal kinect messages.
	the head_isolator picks up head_detections and saves their smaller images and pointclouds.
	Head detections are cut out by using cob_people_detection, scene_publisher and head_isolator on the full database, and saving head detection images using the head_detector/head_detections topic -->
